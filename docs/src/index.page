  %h1 What is Jansi?
.right
  %p
    Jansi is a small java library that allows you to use ANSI escape sequences 
    to format your console output which works even on windows.  
  %p
    Using jansi is easy.  Before you start sending ANSI escape sequences to
    %code System.out
    make sure you run:
        
  :plain
    {coderay::java}
    AnsiConsole.systemInstall();
    {coderay}

  %p
    On Sun JVMs that should replace the System.out implementation, with an 
    the right ANSI aware implementation depending on your Platform.  If 
    you rather not mess with the System.out settings, you can use the
    %code AnsiConsole.out
    PrintStream instead.  For example:
    
  :plain
    {coderay::java}
    AnsiConsole.out.println("Hello World");
    {coderay}
