title: Generating the Docs
--- 

Overview
=============================

We are using [webgen](http://webgen.rubyforge.org/) for generating nice HTML based documentation.

Installing 
-----------------------------

You first need ruby and rubygems installed on your system. 
You should have gems version of 1.3.4 or greater. You can check this via 

gem --version

To update gems do 
gem update --system 

Then you can install webgen with the following command.

`sudo gem install webgen coderay feedtools haml RedCloth`

Building 
-----------------------------

It's as simple as running `webgen` in the current directory.  Output is stored in 
the `out` directory.
